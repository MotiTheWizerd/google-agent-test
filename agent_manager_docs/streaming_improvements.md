# Streaming Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the key improvements made to enable proper streaming functionality in the Agents Manager module.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enabled Google ADK Streaming

**Problem**: Streaming was not enabled in the Google ADK, so only final responses were returned.

**Solution**: 
- Added correct import: `from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode`
- Configured RunConfig with `StreamingMode.SSE` and `response_modalities=["TEXT"]`
- Passed run_config to `runner.run_async()` in both `run_workflow` and `stream_workflow` methods

### 2. Proper Event Handling

**Problem**: Events were not being processed correctly for streaming output.

**Solution**:
- Implemented correct handling of `event.partial` for incremental text output
- Used `event.is_final_response()` as the canonical signal for completion
- Accumulated partial text chunks and displayed them incrementally
- Added proper final response handling with newline termination

### 3. Console Flushing

**Problem**: Output was buffered and appeared all at once instead of streaming.

**Solution**:
- Added console flushing in `TerminalUIManager.print_streaming_text()` method
- Wrapped flush calls in try/except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully

### 4. Unicode Encoding Error Handling

**Problem**: Emojis caused Unicode encoding errors on Windows systems.

**Solution**:
- Added try/except blocks around all UI print methods
- Implemented fallback to plain text when emoji encoding fails
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility

### 5. Modular Architecture

**Problem**: Monolithic code was difficult to maintain and test.

**Solution**:
- Split AgentsManager into focused modules:
  - WorkflowManager
  - SessionManager
  - RunnerManager
  - WorkflowExecutor
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Improved testability and maintainability

## Technical Implementation Details

### RunConfig Configuration

```python
run_config = RunConfig(
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
    response_modalities=["TEXT"],
)
```

### Event Processing Loop

```python
async for event in runner.run_async(..., run_config=run_config):
    text = None
    if event.content and event.content.parts:
        p0 = event.content.parts[0]
        text = getattr(p0, "text", None)

    # Stream partial chunks
    if text and event.partial:
        self.ui.print_streaming_text(text)
        accumulated_text += text

    # Handle final response
    if event.is_final_response():
        final_piece = text or ""
        full = accumulated_text + final_piece
        if accumulated_text:
            self.ui.console.print("")  # newline after streamed chunks
        if full:
            self.ui.print_final_output(full)
        accumulated_text = ""
```

### Console Flushing

```python
def print_streaming_text(self, text: str) -> None:
    """Print streaming text output incrementally."""
    self.console.print(text, end='')
    try:
        # ensure immediate terminal update
        self.console.file.flush()
    except Exception:
        pass
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Output**: Text appears as it's generated by the AI
2. **Better User Experience**: Immediate feedback during long-running operations
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for encoding issues
5. **Maintainable Code**: Modular architecture for easier future enhancements
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Simple streaming tests
- Complex multi-agent workflows
- Tool usage scenarios
- Error handling scenarios
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows encoding issues)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bidirectional Streaming**: Support for BIDI streaming mode
2. **Audio Streaming**: Support for audio response modalities
3. **Enhanced Progress Indicators**: More sophisticated UI feedback
4. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization of event processing
