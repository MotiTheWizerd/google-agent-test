# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The Agents Manager module has been refactored to improve its architecture by splitting the monolithic `AgentsManager` class into smaller, more focused modules. This change enhances maintainability, testability, and extensibility while preserving the existing public API.

## New Module Structure

The refactored architecture consists of the following modules:

### 1. AgentsManager (Coordinator)
- **Role**: Main orchestrator that coordinates between all other modules
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Delegates tasks to specialized modules
  - Maintains the public API interface
  - Manages module instantiation and dependencies

### 2. WorkflowManager
- **Role**: Handles workflow registration, retrieval, and listing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store and manage workflow configurations
  - Provide workflow lookup functionality
  - Check workflow existence

### 3. SessionManager
- **Role**: Manages session creation and retrieval
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create new sessions or retrieve existing ones
  - Generate session IDs when not provided
  - Handle session service interactions

### 4. RunnerManager
- **Role**: Manages runner creation and configuration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create runners for agents
  - Configure runners with proper parameters
  - Handle runner lifecycle

### 5. WorkflowExecutor
- **Role**: Orchestrates workflow execution
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute workflows with given parameters
  - Process events and capture results
  - Handle agent creation from configurations
  - **Streaming Support**: Enable real-time output streaming with proper event handling

### 6. Existing Modules (Unchanged)
- **AgentFactory**: Creates agents from configurations
- **WorkflowBuilder**: Builds workflow configurations
- **Agent Types**: Configuration schemas and enums
- **TerminalUIManager**: Handles terminal output (in the UI module)

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each module now has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 2. Improved Testability
Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test in isolation.

### 3. Better Maintainability
Changes to one aspect of the system (e.g., session management) only affect the relevant module.

### 4. Enhanced Extensibility
New features can be added to specific modules without affecting others.

### 5. Clearer Code Organization
The codebase is now better organized with a logical separation of concerns.

### 6. Enhanced Streaming Support
The refactored implementation now properly supports real-time streaming with:
- Proper RunConfig configuration with StreamingMode.SSE
- Correct handling of partial responses and final responses
- Console flushing for immediate output display
- Unicode encoding error handling for cross-platform compatibility

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility. All existing code that uses the AgentsManager public API will continue to work without any changes.

## Migration for Existing Code

No migration is required for existing code. The refactoring is internal and does not affect the public interface of the AgentsManager class.

## Testing

All modules have been tested to ensure they work correctly together. The existing example scripts and tests continue to pass.
